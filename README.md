# Classification with fully connected networks on the IRIS dataset
## **Introduction**
In this exercise, in order to know that image data can be used in non-image problems as well, we will use the iris structured data set including 4 features for the length and width of sepals and petals, so that we can distinguish the type of flower from 3 different classes based on these features.

In this exercise, I want to use the iris dataset.

The description of this dataset is available on its website:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris

The features and classes of this dataset are as follows:

Attribute Information:

1. sepal length in cm
2. sepal width in cm
3. Petal length in cm
4. Petal width in cm

classes:
* Iris Setosa
* Iris Versicolour
* Iris Virginica

This dataset is available in the sklearn library

## **Conclusion**
I used **Fully Connected Networks** including 3 fully connected layers and 2 layers for Dropouts:

**Final test set loss: 0.105403**<br>
**Final test set accuracy: 0.966667**
